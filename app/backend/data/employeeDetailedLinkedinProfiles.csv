I am self-driven and love to take ownership and I am always ready to wear multiple hats to meet the desired outcome. So this made me a T-shaped designer. The horizontal stem of T presents my expertise in UX research, Interaction & visual design and the vertical stem of T presents my core expertise in Product Design and Design systems.

As a services Company, They have to keep track of clients, their projects and overall progress on projects. Also, They monitor Employees day-to-day activities on different tasks. Previously, They were using Excel Sheets and certain activity tracking platforms to manage this whole process but none were fitting their needs. They were looking for a secure, customized system integrated with existing tools they were using to automate the complete process, which was otherwise, cumbersome to manage on Excel Sheets.

I took the challenge to address this particular business problem and developed an End-to-End Time tracking system for their employees using Django at the back-end and jQuery, Bootstrap & Django templates at front-end. The app manages monthly plan, monitors employee’s activity, analyze the data and generates reports using descriptive statistical techniques. I also integrated this system to their existing timetracking tools like hubstaff.

👉 Responsibilities:
As a sole developer, I had to manage all the client communications, requirement gathering, Design, implementation and testing processes which really put my Software Engineering skills to test. However, This rigorous procedure helped me in my learning in a lot of different ways.

📝Learning Outcomes:
◆ It made my proficient in django, JQuery,Bootstrap and Git.
◆ It increased my self learning skills and ability to adapt to different situations quickly. 
◆ I learned to manage my time efficiently as I am also Computer Science Student.
◆ It provided a priceless real life experience of complete SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) along with understanding of customer’s perspective of the product.  

🏁 Current Status:
The system is currently in production and I am exploring React JS these days along with small maintenance tasks. We are working on migrating the front end system from Django Templates to React JS.
